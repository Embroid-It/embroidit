# Embroid-It

Embroid-It is an open source editing software for use in machine embroidery design. The application was started by a group of undergraduate students at Eastern Washington University as a senior capstone. Written in Java, the application uses the JavaFX API for shape representation, and has support for the PES file format. The project is provided as open source under the BSD 3-Clause license.

## Development

The project is open source and provided under the BDS 3-Clause License. We encourage developers to use, and modify the project as they see fit.

### Project Setup

The Embroid-It front end is constructed using the Netbeans IDE, and the JavaFX Scenebuilder 2.0 Visual Layout Tool. Links to these tools and how to get started with them and JavaFX can be found at the links below.
