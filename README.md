# Embroid-It

Embroid-It is an open source editing software for use in machine embroidery design. The application was started by a group of undergraduate students at Eastern Washington University as a senior capstone. Written in Java, the application uses the JavaFX API for shape representation, and has support for the PES file format. The project is provided as open source under the BSD 3-Clause license.
